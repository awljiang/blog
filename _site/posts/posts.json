Missed out on what happened in between.\r\n\r\n\r\nInclude analysis on the snapshot of 2014 (5 years ago).\r\n\r\n\r\n1.2 Aesthetics\r\n\r\n\r\nS.N\r\n\r\n\r\nCritiques\r\n\r\n\r\nSuggestions\r\n\r\n\r\n6\r\n\r\n\r\nThe word “June” is labelled multiple (6) times on the chart.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs the reference period for the Comprehensive Labour Force Survey is always as at June, suggest to amend the note at the bottom of the chart to “Data for each year are for June periods, and may not add up to 100% due to rounding.”\r\n\r\n\r\n7\r\n\r\n\r\nThe colour tone of the chart’s background is very closer to the tone of the 2009 line, which makes it difficult to read the trend.\r\nResolution of the chart is also very poor, making it even more difficult to read the trends and figures in the table.\r\n\r\n\r\nIncrease the transparency of the background colour and use a different colour from the background. Higher resolution image should be attached in the report instead.\r\n\r\n\r\n8\r\n\r\n\r\nThe vertical dotted lines (reference line) are too thin and makes it difficult to differentiate the colour between the two lines.\r\n\r\n\r\nWeight of the reference lines (if any) should be heavier/more\r\n\r\n\r\n9\r\n\r\n\r\nNo annotation on the charts and hence readers may not notice any interesting findings.\r\n\r\n\r\nInclude annotation in the chart to bring out interesting findings.\r\n\r\n\r\n2.0 Proposed Design\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nS.N\r\n\r\n\r\nAdvantages\r\n\r\n\r\n1\r\n\r\n\r\nReduce the number of age groups to focus on the 3 main broad groups for better focus and easier to related back to the analysis.\r\n\r\n\r\n2\r\n\r\n\r\nBar chart instead of line graph since age bands are categorical.\r\nBy showing only 2019 data, readers can have a quick sense of the 2019 labour market (it’s a 2019 labour market report).\r\n\r\n\r\n3\r\n\r\n\r\nLabels are next to the bars, hence readers do not need to look around the chart or the table for the value.\r\n\r\n\r\n4\r\n\r\n\r\nIncluded a chart for participation rate by age and median age so that readers can better relate the analysis with the charts.\r\n\r\n\r\n5\r\n\r\n\r\nInstead of showing charts on shares/participation rate for 2009 and 2014, it will be helpful to show the change in percentage points since 2009 and 2014 respectively as readers do not need to compute the change mentally. The 2014 data also provides readers additional view of the recent 5 years.\r\n\r\n\r\n6\r\n\r\n\r\nRemove “June” label from the title of the charts and include additional notes at the bottom.\r\n\r\n\r\n7\r\n\r\n\r\nWhite background for better contrast with the charts presented.\r\n\r\n\r\n8\r\n\r\n\r\nBy having separate colours for positive and negative values, readers can easily know if the change is positive or negative.\r\n\r\n\r\n3.0 Data Visualisation Steps\r\n3.1 Data Preparation\r\n3.1.1 Resident Labour Force dataset\r\nStep 1: Download “Table (7) Resident Labour Force Aged Fifteen Years and Over by Age and Sex, 2009 – 2019 (June)” from https://stats.mom.gov.sg/Pages/Labour-Force-Tables2019.aspx.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStep 2: Format the excel. Unmerge the cells and remove unnecessary rows/columns. Unmerge row 5, rename column D as “Age” and delete columns A-C, F, H, J, L, N, P, R, T, V, X and Z (i.e. empty columns). Delete rows 1-4, 6 and 19. Rename the columns to include “(old)” and save the excel file.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStep 3: Open Tableau and connect to the excel file saved out in Step 2.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA view of the table in Tableau\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStep 4: Pivot the table and rename the columns to “Year” and “Counts”.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStep 5: Right click on the drop down list under “Age” column, click “Create Group” to create 3 groups “15 - 24”, “25 - 54” and “55 & over” by highlighting the subgroups and clicking on the “Group” button. Rename the group and repeat for the other 2 groups.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStep 6: Open a new worksheet in Tableau and drag “Age (group)” to Columns, “Year” to Rows and “Counts” to “Text” in the marks card. To obtain the row total, click on “Analysis” and drag “Totals” to “Rows Grand Totals”.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStep 7: To obtain the share (%), click on “Sum(Counts)” in the marks card, and click on “Quick Table Calculations” and select “Percent of Total”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStep 8: Save this table for using in the visualisation by clicking on “Analysis” at the ribbon bar, select “View Data”, followed by “Export All” and save into a folder.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3.1.2 Resident Labour Force Participation Rate dataset\r\nStep 1: Download Labour Force Participation rate dataset from Singstat Table Builder (https://www.tablebuilder.singstat.gov.sg/publicfacing/mainMenu.action) by following the illustration below\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStep 2: Open the excel file and copy the “outside labour force” table to the top right as shown below. Rename the years “In” and “Out” to reflect the counts for in and out of labour force. Delete rows 1-5, 7, 19 onward and rename column A to “Age”. Save the Excel file.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA view of the final table in Excel\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStep 3: Open Tableau window and import the Excel saved in Step 2.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStep 4: Right click on the drop down list under “Age” column, click “Create Group” to create 3 groups “15 - 24”, “25 - 54” and “55 & over” by highlighting the subgroups and clicking on the “Group” button. Rename the group and repeat for the other 2 groups.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStep 5: To obtain the labour force participation counts by the newly created age bands, click to open a new Tableau workbook. Drag “Measure Names” to “Columns”, “Age (group)” to “Rows”, and “Measure Values” to the Text marks card as shown below.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStep 6: Save this table by clicking on “Analysis” at the ribbon bar, select “View Data”, followed by “Export All” and save into a folder.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStep 7: Drag the csv file saved in Step 6 into the polaris, right click the drop down list for the column “Year_In/Out” and click on Split. Rename the new columns “Year” and “In/Out”.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStep 8: Open a new Tableau workbook, drag “In/Out” into “Columns”, “Age (group)” and “Year” into “Rows” and “Counts” into the Text marks card. Click on “Analysis” and drag “Total” into “Row Grand Totals”.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStep 9: To compute participation rate (%), click on the “Analysis” ribbon and select “Percentage of” and click “Row in Pane”.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStep 10: Save this table by clicking on “Analysis” at the ribbon bar, select “View Data”, followed by “Export All” and save into a folder.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStep 11: Open the csv file saved in step 10. To get the labour force participation rate, filter the column “In/Out” and delete rows that are “Out” (“In” refers to individuals in the labour force while “Out” refers to individuals not in the labour force). Save the file.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3.1.3 Median Age of Labour Force\r\nStep 1: Download “Table (2) Key Characteristics of Resident Labour Force, 2009 – 2019 (June)” from https://stats.mom.gov.sg/Pages/Labour-Force-Tables2019.aspx.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStep 2: Keep only columns B and G, delete rows 1-6 and 18 onward. Insert one row in row 1 and label “Year” and “Median Age”, to obtain the table below. Save the excel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3.2 Tableau Works\r\n3.2.1 Importing and transforming data for creation of visualisation\r\nStep 1: Import csv file for shares of resident labour force saved in 3.1.1 (step 8).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStep 2: Remove the old dataset and drag in the share file. Delete the first two columns, and rename last column to “Share”.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStep 3: To obtain shares in %, click on the drop down under “Share” column and select “Create Calculated Field”. Type the formula shown below and click “OK”. Rename the new column as “Shares (%)”.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStep 4: Import participation rate csv file saved in 3.1.2 (step 11) by adding a connection.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStep 5: Drag in the participation rate file to create a union with the labour force share file and edit the relationship as shown below.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStep 6: To obtain the participation rate in %, click on the drop down and create a calculated field as shown below.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStep 7: For both data in step 6 and 3, change the data type for “Year” to date as shown below.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStep 8: Add new data source to import median age data obtained from 3.1.3 (step 2). Similar to step 7, change the data type for “Year” to date.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3.2.2 Creation of charts to show shares of resident labour force\r\nDo steps 1 - 5 to create visualisation for 2019 labour force data, and steps 6 - 8 for comparison with 2009 and 2014.\r\nStep 1: Open a new Tableau worksheet. Drag “Shares (%)” to “Columns”, “Age (group)” to “Rows” and “Year” to filter marks card. In the filter, select “Year”, then “Next” and check the box for 2019.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStep 2: Drag “Shares (%)” to the text marks card, click the green pill, select “format” to format the labeling of the bars.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStep 3: (To do formatting of the chart e.g. remove the grid lines etc) Click on the x-axis and select “format” and select “None” for the Grid lines under “Sheet”, “Columns” and “Rows”.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStep 4: Click on the x-asix and un-tick “Show Header”.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStep 5: Click on colour in the marks card and select the colour for the bar.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStep 6: Go to “Data Source” sheet and create 2 calculated fields as shown below.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStep 7: Create another 2 calculated fields to obtain the change in percentage points since 2009 and 2014.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStep 8: Open a new Tableau worksheet. Drag “Percentage Change wrt 2009” and “Percentage Change wrt 2014” into “Columns” and “Age (group)” into Rows\" as shown below. Ensure that “Bar” is being selected at the marks card. Drag “Percentage Change wrt 2009” and “Percentage Change wrt 2014” into their respective Text marks card for the label to appear and format the label to show in “pp” (similar to step 2). Ensure that the range for both charts are the sam by clicking on the x-axis, then click “Edit axis”. Click on the x-axis and y-axis and un-tick “Show Header” to hide the axis. Drag “Percentage Change wrt 2009” and “Percentage Change wrt 2014” into colour marks card to format the colour of the bar as shown below.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3.2.3 Creation of Charts to show participation rate\r\nRepeat the steps in 3.2.2 (steps 1 - 5) to create visualisation for 2019 participation rate, and the steps in 3.2.2 (steps 6 - 8) for comparison with 2009 and 2014.\r\nStep 1 - 5: Repeat the steps in 3.2.2 (steps 1 - 5) for participation rate data and the final visualisation is as below\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStep 6 - 7: Repeat the steps in 3.2.2 (steps 6 - 7) with the following formula\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStep 8: Repeat the steps in 3.2.2 (step 8) and the final visualisation is as below\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3.2.4 Creation of Charts to show median age trend\r\nStep 1: Open a new Tableau worksheet and select data source “Median Age”. Drag “Year” into “Columns”, “Median Age” into “Rows” and Text marks card to obtain the following chart (ensure to select Line in the marks card)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4.0 Final Data Visualisation Output\r\nData Visualisation Link (Tableau Online):\r\nhttps://public.tableau.com/views/DataVizMakeoverSingaporesResidentLabourForcein2019/FinalDashboard?:language=en&:display_count=y&:origin=viz_share_link\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMajor Insights\r\n\r\n\r\nS.N\r\n\r\n\r\nInsights\r\n\r\n\r\n1\r\n\r\n\r\nShare of older residents (aged 55 & over) in the labour force rose by 9pp compared to a decade ago to 25%, while share of residents aged 25 - 54 declined by 8pp.\r\n\r\n\r\n2\r\n\r\n\r\nDespite a decline in labour force share, labour force participation rate of aged 25 - 54 rose by 4pp compared to a decade ago to 88%.\r\n\r\n\r\n3\r\n\r\n\r\nShare of residents in the labour force by age and participation rate by age were relatively stable over the last 5 years (2014 - 2019).\r\n\r\n\r\n4\r\n\r\n\r\nMedian Age of residents in the labour force increased from 41 years old in 2009 to 44 years old in 2019.

    "contents": "\r\n1.0 Overview\r\nCorrelation coefficient is a popular statistic that use to measure the type and strength of the relationship between two variables. The values of a correlation coefficient ranges between -1.0 and 1.0. A correlation coefficient of 1 shows a perfect linear relationship between the two variables, while a -1.0 shows a perfect inverse relationship between the two variables. A correlation coeficient of 0.0 shows no linear relationship between the two variables.\r\nWhen multivariate data are used, the correlation coeficeints of the pair comparisons are displayed in a table form known as correlation matrix or scatterplot matrix.\r\nThere are three broad reasons for computing a correlation matrix.\r\nTo reveal the relationship between highdimensional variables pairwisely.\r\nTo input into other analyses. For example, people commonly use correlation matrixes as inputs for exploratory factor analysis, confirmatory factor analysis, structural equation models, and linear regression when excluding missing values pairwise.\r\nAs a diagnostic when checking other analyses. For example, with linear regression a high amount of correlations suggests that the linear regression’s estimates will be unreliable.\r\nWhen the data is large, both in terms of the number of observations and the number of variables, Corrgram tend to be used to visually explore and analyse the structure and the patterns of relations among variables. It is designed based on two main schemes:\r\nRendering the value of a correlation to depict its sign and magnitude, and\r\nReordering the variables in a correlation matrix so that “similar” variables are positioned adjacently, facilitating perception.\r\nIn this hands-on exercise, you will learn how to plot data visualisation for visualising correlation matrix with R. It consists of three main sections. First, you will learn how to create correlation matrix using pairs() of R Graphics. Next, you will learn how to plot corrgram using corrplot package of R Lastly, you will learn how to create an interactive correlation matrix using plotly R. .\r\n2.0 Installing and Launching R Packages\r\nBefore you get started, you are required:\r\nto start a new R project, and\r\nto create a new R Markdown document.\r\nNext, you will use the code chunk below to install and launch corrplot, ggpubr, plotly and tidyverse in RStudio.\r\n\r\n\r\npackages = c('ggpubr', 'tidyverse')\r\n\r\nfor(p in packages){library\r\n  if(!require(p, character.only = T)){\r\n    install.packages(p)\r\n  }\r\n  library(p, character.only = T)\r\n}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3.0 Importing and Preparing The Data Set\r\nIn this hands-on exercise, the Wine Quality Data Set of UCI Machine Learning Repository will be used. The data set consists of 13 variables and 6497 observations. For the purpose of this exercise, we have combined the red wine and white wine data into one data file. It is called wine_quality and is in csv file format.\r\n3.1 Importing Data\r\nFirst, let us import the data into R by using read_csv() of readr package.\r\n\r\n\r\nwine <- read_csv(\"data/wine_quality.csv\")\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNotice that beside quality and type, the rest of the variables are numerical and continuous data type.\r\n4.0 Univariate EDA with Histogram\r\nIn the figure below, multiple histograms are plottted to reveal the distribution of the selected variables in the wine quality data sets.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe code chunks used to create the data visualisation consists of two main parts. First, we will create the individual histograms using the code chunk below.\r\n\r\n\r\nfa <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= `fixed acidity`)) +\r\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, color=\"black\", fill=\"light blue\")\r\nva <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= `volatile acidity`)) +\r\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, color=\"black\", fill=\"light blue\")\r\nca <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= `citric acid`)) +\r\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, color=\"black\", fill=\"light blue\")\r\nrs <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= `residual sugar`)) +\r\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, color=\"black\", fill=\"light blue\")\r\nch <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= `chlorides`)) +\r\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, color=\"black\", fill=\"light blue\")\r\nfSO2 <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= `free sulfur dioxide`)) +\r\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, color=\"black\", fill=\"light blue\")\r\ntSO2 <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= `total sulfur dioxide`)) +\r\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, color=\"black\", fill=\"light blue\")\r\ndensity <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= density)) +\r\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, color=\"black\", fill=\"light blue\")\r\npH <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= pH)) +\r\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, color=\"black\", fill=\"light blue\")\r\nsulphates <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= sulphates)) +\r\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, color=\"black\", fill=\"light blue\")\r\nalcohol <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= alcohol)) +\r\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, color=\"black\", fill=\"light blue\")\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNext, the ggarrange function of ggpur package is used to group these histograms together.\r\n\r\n\r\nggarrange(fa, va, ca, rs, ch, fSO2, tSO2, density, pH, sulphates, alcohol, \r\n          ncol = 4, nrow = 3)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
